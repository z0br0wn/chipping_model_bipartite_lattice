chipping_model_bipartite_lattice
================================

This simulation applies the chipping model to a bipartite lattice.  By doing so the probabilities of chipping and hopping become more complex, leading to three phases: fluid, single-condensate, and double-condensate.  By tracking the average mass squared on either sublattice, changes in the organization of mass can be observed.
